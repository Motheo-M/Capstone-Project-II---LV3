# Capstone-Project-II---LV3

## Description of the project
This Polynomial-regression and Linear-regression project plots the points we've inserted on a graph.
and drawsThen a linear and polynomial regression line is drawn to show the relationship between 2 variables.
### What is the project
This project is a Polynomial-regression and Linear-regression plotted graph.

### How does it work
This program takes 2 variables and their datapoints and shows the relationship between
the 2 variables by displaying a linear and polynomial regression line.
